# Development
**Halt!**
Are you **100% sure** your idea doesn't fit better in its own repo, or perhaps another one of our addons?
Loose-knit script repos like this are in danger of turning into a unmaintainable dumping ground. Please do your best to keep it clean and reasonable.


⚠️ The project structure and these rules are subject to change as we add more scripts.

All scripts should follow these rules:
 - Be contained to a single directory under `lua/cfc_gmod_scripts/`
 - Have an `init.lua` at the root of their directory
 - Have a section in this README under the [Included Scripts](#included-scripts) category
 - Ideally, have a convar to enable/disable them
