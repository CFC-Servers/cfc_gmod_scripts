# cfc_gmod_scripts
A disgusting pile of loose-knit, à la carte scripts for Garry's Mod

# Included Scripts

## `cw_extrema_ratio_fix`

### Description
Fixes the on-tick `hudScaler` error spam.


# Development
⚠️ The project structure and these rules are subject to change as we add more scripts.

All scripts should follow these rules:
 - Be contained to a single directory under `lua/cfc_gmod_scripts/`
 - Have an `init.lua` at the root of their directory
 - Have a section in this README under the [Included Scripts](#included-scripts) category
 - Ideally, have a convar to enable/disable them
